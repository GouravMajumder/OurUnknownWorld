                </h2>
                <p class="lead">IN THE HOT, EXPANSIVE KARAKUM desert in Turkmenistan, near the 350-person village of
                    Darvaza, is a hole 230 feet wide that has been on fire for over 40 years.

                    Though technically called the Darvaza gas crater, locals know the crater as “The Gates of Hell.” Its
                    fiery glow can be seen for miles around.


                    The Gates of Hell crater was created in 1971 when a Soviet drilling rig accidentally punched into a
                    massive underground natural gas cavern, causing the ground to collapse and the entire drilling rig
                    to fall in. Having punctured a pocket of gas, poisonous fumes began leaking at an alarming rate.

                    To head off a potential environmental catastrophe, the Soviets set the hole alight, figuring it
                    would stop burning within a few weeks. Decades later, and the fiery pit is still going strong. The
                    Soviet drilling rig is believed to still be down there somewhere, on the other side of the “Gates of
                    Hell.”

                    Amazingly, despite the crater’s foreboding name and ever-present flames, people still trek into the
                    desert to witness the site in all its blazing glory. The country’s government hopes it’ll become a
                    tourist site, and the nearby desert has already become a popular place to wild camp.</p>
