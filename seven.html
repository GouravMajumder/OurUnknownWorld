                        </h2>
                        <p class="lead">Unicorn, mythological animal resembling a horse or a goat with a single horn on
                            its forehead. The unicorn appeared in early Mesopotamian artworks, and it also was referred
                            to in the ancient myths of India and China. The earliest description in Greek literature of
                            a single-horned (Greek monokerōs, Latin unicornis) animal was by the historian Ctesias (c.
                            400 BCE), who related that the Indian wild ass was the size of a horse, with a white body,
                            purple head, and blue eyes, and on its forehead was a cubit-long horn coloured red at the
                            pointed tip, black in the middle, and white at the base. Those who drank from its horn were
                            thought to be protected from stomach trouble, epilepsy, and poison. It was very fleet of
                            foot and difficult to capture. The actual animal behind Ctesias’s description was probably
                            the Indian rhinoceros. Certain poetical passages of the Bible refer to a strong and splendid
                            horned animal called reʾem. This word was translated “unicorn” or “rhinoceros” in many
                            versions of the Bible, but many modern translations prefer “wild ox” (aurochs), which is the
                            correct meaning of the Hebrew reʾem. As a biblical animal, the unicorn was interpreted
                            allegorically in the early Christian church. One of the earliest such interpretations
                            appears in the ancient Greek bestiary known as the Physiologus, which states that the
                            unicorn is a strong, fierce animal that can be caught only if a virgin maiden is placed
                            before it. The unicorn leaps into the virgin’s lap, and she suckles it and leads it to the
                            king’s palace. Medieval writers thus likened the unicorn to Christ, who raised up a horn of
                            salvation for mankind and dwelt in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Other legends tell of the
                            unicorn’s combat with the elephant, whom it finally spears to death with its horn, and of
                            the unicorn’s purifying of poisoned waters with its horn so that other animals may drink.
