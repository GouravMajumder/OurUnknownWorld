                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Hydnellum peckii. <span class="text-muted">--Devil's Tooth</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">The reason that this mushroom is known as The Devil's Tooth, or the Bloody Tooth, is the
                    fact that the red ooze and sockets in it look similar to that of an extracted tooth. But why is this
                    mushroom like this? Well, let's look at the science and find out!
                    These mushrooms start off as white but turn into a pinkish-brown color later on in their
                    development. They can even look almost black in areas where they are bruised. One of the most
                    striking characteristics of this fungi is the fact that it exudes a blood-red liquid when it is
                    moist.


                    On the top of the mushroom are tiny hairs that make the mushroom feel similar to velvet or felt. The
                    bottom also looks like it is covered in stalactites. These can also be covered in amber droplets
                    that make it look stunning.


                    This mushroom forms a mutual relationship with the trees it relies on. It provides the tree with
                    vitamins and minerals, asking for only carbon in return. However, despite not being toxic, this
                    mushroom is in no way edible. The extreme bitterness of it deters anyone from using this fungus in
                    their cooking. </p>
