                <p class="lead">The sun may appear to be the largest star in the sky but that's just because it's the
                    closest. On a stellar scale, it's really quite average — about half of the known stars are larger;
                    half are smaller. The largest known star in the universe is UY Scuti, a hypergiant with a radius
                    around 1,700 times larger than the sun. And it's not alone in dwarfing Earth's dominant star.
                    In 1860, German astronomers at the Bonn Observatory first cataloged UY Scuti, naming it BD -12 5055.
                    During a second detection, the astronomers realized it grows brighter and dimmer over a 740-day
                    period, leading astronomers to classify it as a variable star. The star lies near the center of the
                    Milky Way, roughly 9,500 light-years away.

                    Located in the constellation Scutum, UY Scuti is a hypergiant, the classification that comes after
                    supergiant, which itself comes after giant. Hypergiants are rare stars that shine very brightly.
                    They lose much of their mass through fast-moving stellar winds.
                    It's 265 times more massive than our sun – nearly twice as massive as what astronomers thought was
                    possible. ... In terms of sheer physical size, the star UY Scuti is considered the biggest known.
                    It's only 30 times the sun's mass, but has a radius more than 1,700 greater than the sun.</p>
