                <p class="lead">n the year 1911, it is said about the disappearing mysterious train (train mysterious
                    disappearance) that was already seen in Mexico in the 1840s.


                    There is more than one story to be said about the mysterious trains and platforms, but above all,
                    the Italian train which disappeared along with the passengers. In the year 1911, a company named
                    Zanetti disappeared into a tunnel before reaching its destination. After that, he did not know
                    anything. The most interesting thing is that it is said about the train, he has done time travel
                    with the help of supernatural power.
                    Events before the first world war

                    The talk starts in June 1911. In June of the same year, an Italian railway company Zanetti announced
                    a free ride for a new model of its train. For this, there were 6 railway employees including 100
                    passengers. The train had good food and drink arrangements and the passengers were waiting to reach
                    the destination comfortably. Meanwhile, the train disappeared after reaching a tunnel. A lot of
                    research was done about him but no trace of the train was found.

                    The further story came out later

                    2 passengers out of 106 people of the train came out safely. He was very mentally disturbed and in a
                    very bad condition. After much treatment and mental health treatment, the traveler finally returned
                    to normal. However, he was not ready to say anything about this incident. Eventually one of them
                    told that as soon as he reached the tunnel that day, thick white smoke started filling the train.
                    People suddenly got nervous and started screaming. Almost everyone felt that a big accident has
                    happened on the train.</p>
