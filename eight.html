                <p class="lead">Dwarka has commanded much attraction because the site is one of the four Dhamas (sacred
                    place for pilgrimage) of the Hindu religion. As the legend goes, Krishna founded the city in
                    Gujarat’s west coast.
                    The modern city of Dwarka, which in Sanskrit means ‘Gateway to heaven’, is located north-west of the
                    state.

                    Marine scientists say archaeological remains discovered 36 m (120 ft) underwater in the Gulf of
                    Cambay off the western coast of India could be over 9,000 years old. It is believed to predate the
                    oldest known remains in the subcontinent by more than 5,000 years. Carbon dating on debris recovered
                    from the site, including construction material, pottery, sections of walls, beads, sculpture and
                    human bones and teeth, put it at nearly 9,500 years old, making it older than the Sumerian
                    civilisation by several thousand years. It is also older than the Egyptian and Chinese
                    civilisations. The city is believed to be even older than the ancient Harappan civilisation. Dwarka
                    is mentioned in a number of texts, including the Mahabharata, the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, the
                    Harivamsha as well as the Skanda Purana, and the Vishnu Purana. The Mahabharata says that Dwarka had
                    9,00,000 royal palaces, all constructed with crystal and silver, and decorated with emeralds. It was
                    supposed to have been built on six blocks, two on the right bank and four on the left. Whatever has
                    been traced so far conforms to the description to a large extent.

                    The city was also extremely well planned: divided into six sectors which were in turn divided into
                    residential, commercial areas. The city was home to beautiful large roads, gardens and artificial
                    lakes. It is said that it was submerged in the big flood 9,000 years ago.</p>
