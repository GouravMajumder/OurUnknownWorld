                <p class="lead">Oumuamua is the first known interstellar object detected passing through the Solar
                    System. Formally designated 1I/2017 U1, it was discovered by Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS
                    telescope at Haleakalā Observatory, Hawaii, on 19 October 2017, 40 days after it passed its closest
                    point to the Sun on 9 September. When it was first observed, it was about 33 million km (21 million
                    mi; 0.22 AU) from Earth (about 85 times as far away as the Moon), and already heading away from the
                    Sun.

                    ʻOumuamua is a small object estimated to be between 100 and 1,000 metres (300 and 3,000 ft) long,
                    with its width and thickness both estimated to range between 35 and 167 metres (115 and 548 ft).
                    It has a red color, similar to objects in the outer Solar System. Despite its close approach to the
                    Sun, ʻOumuamua showed no signs of having a coma, but did exhibit non‑gravitational
                    acceleration. Nonetheless, the object could be a remnant of a disintegrated rogue comet (or
                    exocomet), according to a NASA scientist. The object has a rotation rate similar to the
                    average spin rate seen in Solar System asteroids, but many valid models permit it to be more
                    elongated than all but a few other natural bodies. While an unconsolidated object (rubble pile)
                    would require it to be of a density similar to rocky asteroids, a small amount of internal
                    strength similar to icy comets would allow a relatively low density. ʻOumuamua's light curve,
                    assuming little systematic error, presents its motion as tumbling, rather than smoothly rotating,
                    and moving sufficiently fast relative to the Sun that it is likely of an extrasolar origin.
                    Extrapolated and without further deceleration, ʻOumuamua's path cannot be captured into a solar
                    orbit, so it would eventually leave the Solar System and continue into interstellar space.
                    ʻOumuamua's planetary system of origin and the age of its excursion are unknown.

                    In July 2019, astronomers concluded that ʻOumuamua is most likely a natural object. A small number
                    of astronomers suggested that ʻOumuamua could be a product of alien technology, but evidence in
                    support of this hypothesis is weak. In March 2021, scientists presented a theory based on
                    nitrogen ice that ʻOumuamua may be a piece of an exoplanet, similar to the dwarf planet Pluto, from
                    beyond our solar system.</p>
