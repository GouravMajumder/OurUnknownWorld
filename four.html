                <h2 class="featurette-heading">Stanley Meyer's water fueled car<span class="text-muted"> and his
                        mysterious death.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Meyer’s invention promised a revolution in the automotive industry. It worked through an
                    electric water fuel cell, which divided any kind of water — including salt water — into its
                    fundamental elements of hydrogen and oxygen, by utilizing a process far simpler than the
                    electrolysis method.

                    Despite skepticism about the legitimacy of a car that runs on water, Meyer was able to patent his
                    invention under Section 101 of the Subject Matter Eligibility Index, meaning he proved to a patent
                    review board that his invention worked reliably.

                    Meyer’s water-powered engine was the result of 20 years of research and dedication, and he claimed
                    it was capable of converting tap water into enough hydrogen fuel to drive his car from one end of
                    the country to the other. His invention was mind-boggling and promised a future of non-polluting
                    vehicles that could be refueled with a garden hose.
                    On March 21, 1998, Meyer was having lunch at a Cracker Barrel with his brother and two potential
                    Belgian investors. The four clinked their glasses to toast their commitment to uplifting the world,
                    but after taking a sip of his cranberry juice, Meyer clutched his throat, sprang to his feet, and
                    ran outside. Rushing after him, his brother Stephen found him down on his knees, vomiting violently.
                    He quickly muttered his last words, “They poisoned me.”

                    Meyer’s death was investigated for three months, though it was eventually written on the coroner’s
                    report that he died of a cerebral aneurysm.

                    Stephen Meyer insists his brother was murdered. After all, Meyer’s invention posed an incalculable
                    threat to billions of oil industry dollars and untold fortunes, and he’d successfully resisted
                    succumbing to numerous buyout offers. Additionally, the inventor had warded off pressure from
                    numerous overseas visitors and weathered persistent government spying operations. And, perhaps not
                    so strangely, those investors who dined with the Meyer brothers on that fateful day declined to
                    offer so much as a condolence following Meyer’s demise.</p>
